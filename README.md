# SAE-Formative-MonsterFightSimulator
Monster Fight simulator 

This project is from the exercice "Formative - OOP Minigame (Monster Fight Simulator)" on the drive

Simple project that simulates a fight between two monsters

Each monster has :
Health Point
Attack Point
Defense Point
Speed
Race

Each monster can : 
Attack (damage is Attack points - defense points)
Heal (recover a few health points)
Pary (monster gets bonus defense points for 2 rounds)

A monster cannot fight a monster with the same race.

At the start of the program, the player decided which monsters will fight againts eahc other. The monster with the highest speed attacks first
Then the program run in form of rounds where each monster performs an action. The program ends when one of the monster health points drops to 0 or below.
The program then tells who won.

I added a few "animations" and a round resume at then end of each rounds
